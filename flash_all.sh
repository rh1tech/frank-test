# There is no way to automate this end to end. The two RP2350s have
# separate USB-C ports (J8 master, J9 slave) and separate BOOTSEL/RUN
# button pairs, and nothing on the board lets one reset the other, so
# the operator has to move the cable and press the buttons. This script
# just sequences the prompts so neither half gets forgotten.
