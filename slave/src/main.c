/*
 * main.c — slave (RP2350, U6) link responder and self-test.
 *
 * The slave has no display of its own: its job is to answer the master
 * over the parallel link, and to run the same flash/PSRAM battery the
 * master runs locally so both halves of the board appear side by side
 * on the master's screen.
 *
 * It runs its self-test once at boot, before the master is likely to
 * have finished its own, and then serves requests forever. The results
 * are cached rather than re-measured per request so a LINK_OP_SELFTEST
 * answers immediately instead of blocking the master for a second.
 *
 * The blue LED (LD2, GPIO26) beats from a timer IRQ:
 *   slow  — booted, waiting for the master
 *   fast  — serving a request
 *   rapid — self-test failed
