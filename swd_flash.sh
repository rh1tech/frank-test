# swd_flash.sh — flash over SWD with a Raspberry Pi Debug Probe.
#
# Strongly preferred over flash.sh once a probe is attached. USB-BOOTSEL
# flashing needs a button press whenever the firmware wedges — which is
# exactly when you are iterating fastest — and `picotool reboot -u` is
# unreliable against a target that has faulted into lockup. SWD does not
# care what the target is doing.
#
# Wiring: probe SWD to J1 (master, U3) or J3 (slave, U6). Both headers
# are pin 1 = SWDIO, pin 2 = GND, pin 3 = SWCLK.
#
# Usage: ./swd_flash.sh master|slave [--reset-only]
#
