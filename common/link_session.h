/*
 * link_session.h — the doorbell-sequenced conversation between the two
 * MCUs, built on link_bus (wire) and link_proto (frames).
 *
 * There is exactly one invariant to keep in your head: DB_MS (driven by
 * the master) means "master is ready for the next step", DB_SM (driven
 * by the slave) means "slave is ready / slave is done". Every phase
 * starts with both low, raises both, does its data transfer, then drops
 * both. Nothing depends on the two chips agreeing about absolute time,
 * which is what lets the slave boot seconds after the master and still
 * join cleanly.
 *
 * Throughput and integrity are measured separately on purpose:
 *
 *   throughput  one uninterrupted ring DMA, no per-block handshake and
 *               no CPU verification, so the number is the wire and
 *               nothing else;
 *   integrity   block-at-a-time with a handshake between each, every
 *               byte compared against the expected pattern.
 *
 * Mixing them would either understate the speed (verification in the
 * hot path) or overstate the confidence (unverified bytes).
