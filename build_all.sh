# build_all.sh — build both halves with matching options.
#
# The two firmwares must agree on CPU_SPEED: the link receiver's PIO
# loop has to keep up with the transmitter's byte period, and both are
# derived from each chip's own system clock. Building them separately at
# different speeds is the easiest way to get a link that half works, so
# this script exists to make the matched build the default path.
